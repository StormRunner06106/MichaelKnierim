      "To advance the development of human-centered adaptive systems, my research focuses on the development of innovative sensing technologies (neural wearables) that promise automated and unobtrusive insight into our daily dynamics of mental demands and recovery. Thereby, we can learn how to create technology that supports our productivity and health in tandem.",
    ethicalNote:
      "Ethical responsibility and transparency are essential in this research, as many technologies today are shaped by profit-driven or surveillance-focused agendas. Aligning with frameworks like the EU AI Act ensures that these innovations genuinely serve societal needs and public well-being. My commitment to such open developments is highlighted in our various open-source software and hardware contributions on neural wearables:",

    additionalInfo:
      "Besides the technology, my research presently focuses a lot on conducting naturalistic studies (real tasks in lab settings or field studies) to generate the critical amounts of data needed for building a better understanding of phenomena that influence our productivity and health at work. This expansion of scope represents a critical research contribution, as comparable prior work or publicly available datasets of this kind are currently lacking. Machine learning is indispensable in this work for extracting latent information from the complex (bio-)data, paving the way for adaptive systems that can respond to our psychological and physiological needs. So if you are interested in combining ML method advancements with these novel types of data, I'd like to talk to you! Please feel free to send me an e-mail if you want to learn more!",
